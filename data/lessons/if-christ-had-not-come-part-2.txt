IF CHRIST HAD NOT COME
John 15:22
There would have been no atonement.
1 Peter 2:24
/own
24 Who his own self bare our sins in his body on
the tree, that we,
being dead to sins,
Should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye
were healed.
Scripture could not state mor plainly the great
redemptive offering of Christ for our sins on the
cross.
IN WHAT WAY DID CHRIST BEAR OUR SINS?
He bore the consequence of our sin, which is death
itself; he suffered seperation, though briefly,
from the presence of God;
He was numbered with the transgressors
He endured a lifetime of exposure to the outrageous
opposition of evil and unscrupulous men.
Have we died to our sins?
The first impulse of the regenerated heart is the
resolution to live above sin.
John 15:13
13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man
lay down his life for his friends.
The highest human exhibitation of love that earth
has ever seen was this. Christ was about to exhibit
this highest human type of love by dieing for his
friends. He did even more, he died for his enemies,
something that man had never done.

2 Corinthians 8:9
9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became
poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
Joseph and Mary were poor.
The riches of Christ are those riches which pertained
to his status with God and equality to God before
the world was, the riches of his eternal power and
godhead, the riches of his everlasting divinity and
glory.
In the words of Paul
"He became poor. . ...
Christs becoming poor has a double meaning!

Referring to the contrast between his eternal
state and his incarnation
2 To the extraordinary poverty of his earthly state
as compared with the affluence of some of his
contemporaries.
'For YOUR SAKES
To redeem men from the curse of sin.
Every man.
Humbled himself.
The simple objective truth of Christianity is
founded upon the conviction of the supernatural.
In the final analysis, if there is no supernatural,
there is no Christianity. Those who call themselves
christians, who do not believe in the supernatural
are unbelievers.
Do you believe the gospel?
Do you believe that Christ existed with God before
the world was created?
Was Christ born as the Bible teaches?

Did Christ rise from the grave?
