Ephesians 4:1-3
Consider your calling
1 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you
that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are
called,
2 With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering
forbearing one another in love;
3 Endeavering to keep the unity of the Spirit in
the bond of peace
Know your weaknesses and fortify yourselves against
them.
Consider the value of the soul
Read Matthew 16:24-28

love and to good works:
To treat others as you wish to be treated

Matthew 7: 7-12
v7 Christ said,
Luke 18:1
1 .....,
that men ought always to pray, and not
to faint;
This is the Savior's great promise that prayer will
be answered, although not always precisely the
manner expected.
God answers prayer
1. Gradually, as in the case of Hawthorne's little
Ernest in the, "Great Stone Face. "
2. As in the case of Jonag.h
3. By denial of the request, as in the case of
Paul's thorne in the flesh.
II Cor 12:7 ...
4. By sending something other than was requested
as in the case of our Lord's prayer for the cup to
pass but which was answered by receiving strength
to drink it.
5. After delay as in the case of Jairus' prayer for
Christ to heal his daughter.
Luke 8:58
