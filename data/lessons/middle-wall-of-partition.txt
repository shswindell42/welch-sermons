THE MIDDLE WALL OF PARTITION
Isiah 57:19-21
19I create the fruit of the lips; peace, peace to
him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith
the Lord; and I will heal him.
20 But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when
it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
21
There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
Ephesians 2:19
Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners
but fellow citizens with the saints, and the house-
hold of God;
20 And are built upon the foundation of the foundation
of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself
being the chief corner stone ;
21 In whom all the building fitly framed together
groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord;
Ephesians
13 But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were
far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one
and hath broken down the middle wall of partition
between lus;

the law of commandments contained in ordinances;
for to make in himself of twain one new man, So
