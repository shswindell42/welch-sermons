THE SECOND COMMANDMENT
Against making and worshipping images
Exodus 20 20:4
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image
Hew
carve
grave
Wood stone
metal
Prohibits every species of idolitary known
Or any likeness
Take heed unto yourselves
lest ye corrupt yourselves
Of any beast or any likeness of any thing that
is in heaven above
or that is in the earth
beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
Among the Egyptians the ox was sacred. They supposed
one of their gods Apis or Mnevis
took up
their abode in the ox or heiffer.
On the death of one he entered into the body
of another.
Stork Crane hawk
these were objects of Egyptians.
Even the frog was a sacred animal.
All fish were considered sacred to the Egyptians.
The sun moon planets stars.
Fire light air darkness
To permit its image worship, the Roman Catholic
Church has left the whole of this second commandment
but to keep up the number they have divided the
tenth into two commandments.
This is totally contrary to the faith of Gods
elect and to the acknowledgement of that truth
which is according to Godliness. The verse is in
all ancient versions according to the Bible wehave.

This corruption of the word of God by the Roman
Catholic Church as a false and heretical Church,
with the deepest brand of ever-during infamy.
All false worship may be considered of this kind
together with all image worship, and all other
superstitious trites and ceremonies,
Exodus 20:5
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve
them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation
of them that hate me;
Jealous God
This shows in a most expressive manner the love
of God to this people. He felt for them as the
most affectionate husband could do for his
spouse: amd was jealous for their fidelity,
because he willed their invarible happiness.
Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children
If the children walk in the steps of their #fathers
for no man can be condemned by divine justice for
a crime of which he was never guilty.
This refers principally to national judgements.
"The Gods whom the Israelites trusted could not
deliver them from their enemies.
