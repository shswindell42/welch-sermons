Let us suppose a group of people hear the gospel
for the first time! All hear the same thing!
Think of the way Jesus came to earth. ..... Tell
Think of the way he left the earth. ....... Tell
Think of the plan of salvation.
How many times were you taught before you
accepted.
FAITH
How hard was it for each of us to accept the
miraculous birth !!!
