WHY WE BELIEVE
in
the
CHURCH
THE CHURCHES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT EVENTUALLY DEPART
ED FROM THE TRUTH
2 Thessalonians 2:1-12
This chapter is written to remove misapprehension
on the subject of the Lord's coming. It shows
that it must not be expected until certain events
have taken place.
1 A falling away
2 The removal of some power which hindered the
manifestation of the man of sin.
3 The manifestation of the man of sin, and following
this, the coming of the Lord. He does not seek to
show all, but some of the events which will precede
Christ's coming.
If I go :
Iwill come again
