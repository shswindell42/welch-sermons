JOE PERRY LITTLE
By Kenneth V Welch
Our Father which art in heaven.
How excellent is thy name in all the earth.
Thou who created the earth and every living
thing therein, even the soul of men.
We come to thee with bowed heads and achingg
hearts. We beseech thy love and mercy and
kindness.
THE GREATEST PRINCE AMONG US HAS FALLEN.
Dear God;
we mourn his passing and his seperati
seperation from us, we pray, that his
family and friends will be strong for the
times that are ahead.
And Father, with our mourning and sad hearts,
we have great comfort because he put his
trust in thee.
we are thankful for those who taught him
the gospel of Christ.
We are thankful for that Great Son, who set
the example, went forward to obey the gospel
and Joe followed. We thank thee that Joe
prepared himself for this occasion. Helpn
us to live so that we too may have a place in
that beautiful home prepared for the soul.
