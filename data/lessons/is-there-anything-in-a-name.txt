IS THERE ANYTHING IN A NAME?
NEW NAME IS THE NAME CHRISTIAN
Acts 11: 26
And when he had found him, he brought him unto
Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year
they assembled themselves with the church, and
taught much people. And the disciples were called
Christians first at Antioch.
God promised that he himself would give his people
a new name
Isaiah 62:2
2 And the gentiles shall see thy righteousness,
and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called
by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall
name.
It was not to be a name which enemies would give,
for God said,
Isaiah 56:5
I will give them an everlasting name, that shall
not be cut off.
The name was given in Gods house and within his
walls; and that cannot mean in the ranks of the
dispisers of the truth. It was to be a new name.
It was to be a name which the mouth of the Lord
would name.
If "disciples" had continued to be the name of Gods
followers, there would have been nothing new in
such a designation, because the Pharisees and John
the Baptist also had "disciples. " Implicit in the
new name was the teaching that Christianity was
never to be confused with Judaism, or any of the
sects of the Jews, all of which had their "disciples."
The Gospel was preached first to the Jews.
The new name did not apply until after the Gospel
was preached to the Gentiles.
