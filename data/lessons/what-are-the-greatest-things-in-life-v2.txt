WHAT ARE THE GREATEST
THINGS OF LIFE
Introduction
Charity or love is no doubt the greatest and most
powerful principle of life
Charity is then personified.
BUT THERE ARE OTHER GREAT PRINCIPLES AND THINGS
OF LIFE WORTHY OF OUR MOST SERIOUS CONSIDERATIONS
The greatest object in life is to purposely glorify
God in all that we do and say.
The greatest privilege in life is the privilege of
bei
being "Sons of God. "
The greatest knowledge in life is to know God and
his Son, Jesus Christ.
But there are still more great things of life
The greatest vocation in life is to work for God
and serve him.
The greatest work in the world is the w o r k of
winning souls
The greatest joy is the joy of salvation
OUR LESSON FOR TODAY
The greatest victory is to overcome self and the
world.
I Corinthians 9:27
27 But I Keep under my body, and bring it into
subjection: lest that by any means, when I have
preached to others, I myself should be a castaway
But I keep under my body, this is an illusion to
boxers and wrestlers which signifies to trip and
give the opponent a fall, and keep him down.

Bethlehem 8-2-87Nichols P 155

And having him acknowlege himself conquered, make
him a slave.
The Apostle considers his body as
an enemy with which he must contend; he must
mortify it by self-denial, abstinence and self
denial and severe labor.
The body must be the
slave of the soul and not the soul the slave of
the body, which is the case in unregenerate men.
Lest having preached to others
refers to the
office of herald, at these games whose business
it was to proclaim the conditions of the game,
exhort the contestants, and declare the terms of
each contest.
Should be a castaway the word signifies such a
person as the judge of the games reject as not h
having deserved the prize.
What is the application?
So Paul himself might be rejected by the great
judge; and to prevent this, he ran, he contended,
he denied himself, and brought his body into
subjection to his spirit, and had his spirit
governed by the spirit of God.
Read Psalms 3
00v
Read I John 5: 3-5
Revelation 3:5
5 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed
in white raiment; and I will not blot out his
name out of the book of life, but I will confess
his name before my father, and before his angels.
