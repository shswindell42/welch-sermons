IF CHRIST HAD NOT COME
John 15:22
My best
22 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they
had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for
their sin.
There would have been no redeeming gospel
2 Timothy 1:10
10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of
our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death,
and hath brought life and immortality to light
through the gospel;
But rish now made manifest
Existed with God before he was born
By the appearing
Is not merely a reference to the birth of Christ,
but to the whole thesis of the incarnation,
together with the life, death, resurrection and
ascension of our Lord.
Abolished death
Made it of none effect. The Christian gospel
robbed death of its terriors and enabled the
Christian to face it with sanity, composure and hope.
Life and immortality
Life after death
Immortality _ __
no decay

To
It may be asked how it can be just in God to
condemn men for ever for not believing the gospel?
Answer
1 God has a right to appoint his own terms of mercy.
2 Man has no claim on him forever.
3 The sinner rejects the terms of salvation
knowingly, deliberately, and perseveringly.
4 He has a special disregard and contempt for the
gospel.
5 His unbelief is produced by the pove of sin.
6 He shows by this that he has no love for God,
and his law, and for eternith.
7 He slights the objects dearest to God and most
like him. .
8 He must be miserable.
3
A creatue who has no confidence in God, who does
not believe that he is true or worthy of his
regard, and who never seeks his favor, must be
wreiched. He rejects God, and he must go into
Akarnity without a Father and without God.
no source of comfort in himself, and
must die forever. There is no being in eternity
but God that can make man happy;
and without his
favor the sinner must be wretched.

There would have been no universal invitation
Matthew 11 : 28-30
28 Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest.
29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I,
am meek and lowly at heart: and ye shall find rest
unto your souls.
30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
These last three verses of chapter 11 are called
the Great Invitation. Those invited are "all ye
that labor and are heavy laden. " Christ's teaching
has a special appeal for the poor, the downtroden,
the despised, rejected, and suffering of earth; but
it is incorrect to assume that only these are invited.
Rather, all men are invited to fly unto Jesus for
peace and redemption; and, in one sense or other,
every soul ever born into this world is "weary"
"heavy laden, " and troubled by the common sorrows
calamities to which flesh is heir. In this larger
view of the unmitigated sorrow in which all men
dwell, the Great Invitation excludes no one. The
common burden of sin, sickness, death, doubt,
dis illusionment, and sorrow is an invariable
heritage of every man coming into this world.
Reasons why men should come to Christ are:
1
For the rest he will give
2 For the rest they will find
3
Because Christ is meek and lowly in heart, thus
fully qualified to provide sympathy, love,
understanding, and whatever else may be required
to alleviate human distress and to provide eternal
life.
4
His yoke is easy and his burden is light.
The hen and chicks illustration is well known to us.
The yoke spoken of here is a yoke made for heavy
loads to be placed on men's shoulders.
Under the yoke of Christ, men can withstand all the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
Men may enquire, "How may men take Christ's yoke
upon them?" This is done, as he said, by those who
"learn" of him. This refers to hearing, believing,
repenting, confessing, being baptized, and walking
in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
Men take Christ's yoke upon them by obeying the
gospel and taking up their full duties in the church.
That such is surely a burden or "yoke," none may
deny; but it is a burden which makes all other
burdens light.
Revelation . 3:20
20 Behold I stand at the door, and knock; if any
man hear my voice, "'and'open the door, I will come
in to him, and will sup with him; and he with me.
Here is the note of deep affection in the metaphor
of the common meal, which the ancients regarded as
a manifestitation of fraternal confidence. The old
term sup here signifies spiritual communion, which
the Lord offered to restore with the Laodiceans.
Our usage of the word today is fellowship.
Here Jesus reverses the order of
Matthew 7:7
7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall
find; knock, and it shall be opened unto ""you:
The Savior does not always answer prayer in exactly
the manner expected.
