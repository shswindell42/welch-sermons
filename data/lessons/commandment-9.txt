THE NINTH COMMANDMENT
Exodus 20:16
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbor.
Not only false oaths, to deprive a man of his life
or of his right, are here prohibited, but all
whispering, tale-bearing, and slander. Suppressing
the truth when known, by which a person may be
defrauded of his property or his good name is also
a crime against this law.
And who is my neighbor?
This question was asked a certain lawyer by Jesus.
After Jesus had told him the story of the certain
man, the priest, the levite and the samartian.
Luke 10:37
37 And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then
said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
By the term neighbor any human being is intended,
whether he rank among our enemies or friends.
Read I Kings 13:7-24
