THE STORY OF RUTH
The Old Testament scriptures do not reveal a sweeter or
more beautiful character nor does any literature contain
a lovelier story then the one for our lesson tonight.
This lesson is called the loveliest speciman of epic and
idyllic poetry which we possess. It is a mystery how
such a wonderful book should be sandwiched between Judges
and ist Samuel. War and bloodshed and many of the sinful
practices are found in Judges and ist Samuel.
The book of Ruth has been described as a beautiful valley
full of flowers and fertile fields and with a gentle brook
quietly singing as it flows through the meadow. The book
of Ruth is a wonderful story of love and of holy character.
It fills that part of the Old Testament with its fragrance.
When a young person dies descriptive words like these often
describe their passing. For instance, in the case of an
infant God is described as one who picks a bouquet and
gathers the most beautiful flowers in the garden. A rose-
oud is a sweet expression of an infant who has passed away.
The gist of the story is a friendship between two women.
Instead of war, strife and political struggle, we have har-
vest festivals, family contigencies and the strange process
by which an extinct family might be restored to the
genealogies of Israel.
It is not known when or by whom the book of Ruth was
written. The events transpired in the days when the
judges judged.
