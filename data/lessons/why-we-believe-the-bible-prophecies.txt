WHY WE BELIEVE THE BIBLE
Prophecies of the Bible always true
Scripture could foresee the future
God would make a great nation of Abraham's seed
Genesis 12:2
2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and
I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and
thou shalt be a blessing:
When God took him from his own people, he promised
to make him the head of another; he cut him off
from being the branch of a wild olive, to make
him the root of a good olive.
This promise was,
A great relief to Abram's burden; for he had now
no child.
God knows how to suit his favors to the wants
and necessities of his children.
"He that has a plaster for every sore will provide
one for that which is most painful".
A great trial to Abram's faith; for his wife had
been long barren.
Iwill bless thee. Leave thy father's house, and
I will give thee a father's blessing.
I will make thy name great. By deserting his
country, he lost his name there. Having no child,
he feared he should have no name;
but God will
make him a great name.
Thou shalt be a blessing;
Thy happiness shall be a sample of happiness.

We may be helped to the knowledge of the call
of Abram by Stephens speech.
Acts 7:2-3
2 And he said, Men, brethen, and fathers,
hearken;
The God of glory appeared unto our
father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, be-
fore he dwelt in Charan,
3 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy
country, and from thy kindred, and come into
the land which I shall show thee.
Galatians 3:16
Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises
made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many;
but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
Numbers 23:9
9 For from the top of the rocks I see him,
and
from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall
dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the
nations.
Matt 10:39
Gal 2:20
