WHY WE BELIEVE THE BIBLE
From whence came this wonderful book?
It is here! It did not write itself.
The Bible claimes to have been written by
inspiration of God.
Deceivers did not write the Bible, nor men
deceived. Would not and could not. Its writers
wrote prophecies of the future as accurately as
historians record the past. About forty men wrote
it over a period of about 1500 years; yet when
put together, their writings make a complete and
harmonious book.
CHRIST ENDORSED THE OLD TESTAMENT
John 5:45-47
45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the
Father: there is one that accuseth you, even
Moses, in whom ye trust.
46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have
believed me: for he wrote of me.
47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall
ye believe my words?
Our Lord here emphasized his true character as
the judge of all men, declining any function of
the prosecuting attorney.
Christ is eternally the Advocate in the presence
of the Father; but he is not the accuser of men;
he is their defender, provided only that they will
come unto him and rely upon his righteousness
to save them.
The Jews Christ addressed were trusting for salv
salvation in the law of Moses, ignorant of law's
ineffectiveness to save anyone. Any person,
breaking the tiniest of its regulations, was in
total condemnation.
It provided no means of forgiveness. There was a
continual remembrance of sin in it.

Christ endorsed the writings of Moses.
Matthew 19:7-8
7 They say unto him, why did Moses then command
to give a writing of divorcement, and to put
her away?
8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness
of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives:
but from the beginning it was not so.
He endorsed the story of Noah and the Flood.
Matthew 24: 37-39
37 But as the days of No'e were, so shall also
the coming of the Son of man be.
38 For as in the days that were before the flood
they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving
in marriage, until the day that No'e entered into
the ark,
39 And knew not until the flood came, and took
them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son
of man be .
He endorsed the story of Lot's wife.
Luke 17:31-32
31 In that day, he which shall be upon the
housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not
come down to take it away: and he that is in the
field, let him likewise not return back.
32 Remember Lot's wife,
He endorsed the story of Jonah and the great fish.

WHY WE BELIEVE THE BIBLE
From whence came this wonderful book?
About forty men wrote the Bible over a period of
1 500years
Christ endorsed the Old Testament
Christ came to fulfill the prophecies
The prophets wrote the life of Christ beforehand
The Bible, actually a collection of sixty-six
small books, tells of the rise and fall of ancient
nations and the clash of armies. It tells about
kings and plain people, heroes and villians. It
contains strange dream-visions, wise sayings and
many facts acceptable as a message from God to
man.
The Bible is scientifically accurate. The Bible
is not a book on science and yet its statements
are scientifically accurate.
The universe of worlds is taught in the Bible.
Hebrews 1:1-3
God, who at sundry times and in divers manners
spake in times past unto the fathers by the
prophets,
2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his
Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things,
by whom also he made the worlds;
3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the
express image of his person, and upholding all
things by the word of his power, when he had by
himself purged our sins, sat down on the right
hand of the Majesty on high;
God who .

Apostle plunges into the midst of his subject.

The Old Testament was given in portions, and at
wide intervals, not all at once.
Spoke
Though prophets might be chosen as the
03
instruments, the message was that of God. While
God spoke through them, the prophets were only
men.
Hath in these last days
At the end of the Law of Moses
Spoken unto us by his Son
Last of all he sent his Son.
The importance of the message is shown by the
messenger.
No longer an inspired prophet, but, instead, the
Son of God is the speaker.
Whom he hath appointed heir of all things.
The Father delivered all things into the hands
of the Son.
Acts 2:36
36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know
assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus,
whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
John 17:10
10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine;
and I am glorified in them.
The heir is the Lord of all.

By whom also he made the worlds
Through his agency, Christ, is represented as
God's medium in creation.
John 1:3
3 All things were made by him; and without him
was not anything made that was made.
3 Who being the brightness of his glory."
Amanifestation of the glory of God
And the express image of his person
In Christ we have a tangible, visible representa-
tion of the substance of God. We see God in him.
And upholding all things by the word of his power,
The Son hath all power, and his power was always
manifested by his word. He spoke and it was done.
When he had by himself purged our sins.
Make an atonement for them.
Sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.
Of God. The right hand was always the place of
honor.
