THE BIBLE
Bible is from the Greek word translated "book".
Heb. 10:7Then said T, Lo, I come (in the volumn of the
book it is written of me) to do thy will , O God.
This is a quote from Psalms 4 0:7
The books in those days were on wooden rollers. As the
roll came off one spool it was rolled on another.
One such roll described was 2 feet 2inches by 100feet
long.
We need to know what our duties toward the Bible are.

Many books -- many should be burned.
Acts 19;19
Many of them also which used curious arts brought
their books together, and burned them before all
men :
and they counted the price of them, and found
it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
It is a shame that in our own times all kinds of
spiritualists, fortune-tellers, palm-readers, and
voodoo specialists, are operating in the same manner
as those ancient sinners. This event took place at
Ephesus. Many books todaydeserve the same fate.

INVESTIGATE THE BIBLE

that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing
the word of truth.
He was not to be ashamed of his work or his Lord.
This passage has been thought by some to mean that
Timothy was not inspired. We have two passages that
indicate otherwise.
1 Timothy 4:14
Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given
thee by prophecy, with the laying on of hands of the
presbytery.
This was the gift of office which was bestowed by the
presbytery.
11 Timothy 1:6
Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, that thou stir up
the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of
my hands.
The gift of miraculous powers was bestowed by an
apostle.

it was offered to the Greek on the same terms.
LOVE THE BIBLE
Many do not
John 5:3
For this is the love of God, that we keep his

The reason shown here that faith alone will not savei
is that faith alone is without love.
