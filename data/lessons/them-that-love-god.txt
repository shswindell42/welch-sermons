The purpose of this lesson is to discuss a
peculiar people. Those who love God are peculiar
We have an incidental lesson in verse 27.
The min
Spirit is a personality and should not be refered
to as it. The Spirit is a Personality and is
part of the Godhead.
We ask the question, Who loves God ??
If we should ask for a show of hands! Who loves
God ?? How many would raise their hands ??
This is a difficult passage. Who are the recipien
recipients of these blessings, that is, who
does the Bible say,
""Loves God"?

success, bodily health, or any other purely mortl
benefit, but is rather a reference to the eternal
happiness of the soul. Whatever might happen to
the Christian in this life, absolutely nothing
can happen to him, that is, is saved inner self.
This is true because God is able to overrule every
earthly circumstance in such a manner as to compel
its contribution to the eternal redemption that
awaits the children of God.
This does not mean that everything will turn out
all right for everybody. There is one limitation
imposed by God himself, "To them that love God. "
"Work together for good. ... " speaks of a situation
in which God is surely at work on the Christians
behalf, but it also speaks of a situation in which
the saved person's reaction to life's woes is a o
controlled response.
Some ships sail east, and some sail west,
By the selfsame winds that blow.
It's the set of the sails and not the gales
That determines the way we go.

The reaction of the child of God, or his response,
to the ills of mortal life must be one of patience,
submission, humility, prayer, love, hope, and faith
Even adversity of the severest kind must be made
to yield its precious fruit in the heart of the
heart of the Christian.
It has been proved again
and again by Christians that, "Prosperty is the
blessing of the OT;
adversity is the blessing off
the new. "

This is important information! Let us read some
statements from the Bible.
He who has My cammandments and keeps them, it is
he who loves Me. John 14: 21 NKJ
For this is the love of God, that we keep his
commandsments. I John 5:3
NKJ
Them that are called according to his purpose. ..
At this point the great biblical doctrines of
calling, foreknowledge, foreordination begin to
emerge.
These great teachings point toward God.
"Those who are called" is simply another way of
designating the saved.
"Those that love God" is an expression designating
the same people. These two clauses also express
important facts in the lives of people.
Who are the called ?
How does the calling occur ?
Paul gave the answer! He called you through the
gospel.
God willed that man should be called by the gospel.

Hence to be called according to God's purpose, is
to be called by the gospel. It is not to be
called by some secret impulse of the Holy Spirit.
Those who accepted the gospel on the day of BB odw
pentecost were called by the preaching of the
TOW
gospel.

This call we are absolutely free to accept or re
reject; and , accordingly, as we do this or that,
we shall be saved or lost.ยบ odw algosq ert 916 odw
