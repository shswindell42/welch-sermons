THE GOODNESS OF GOD
Romans 11: 22
22 Behold, therefore, the goodness and severity of
God: on them which fell severity; but toward thee,
goodness, if thou continue in his goodness:
otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
Ezekiel 33:11
11 Say unto them, as I live, saith the Lord God,
I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but
that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye,
turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, 0
house of Israel?
It does not please God for anyone to be lost. Each
individual is responsible for his own sins. The
father for the son: or the son for the father. It
is through Gods goodness that a way has been provided
for all to be saved.
I Timothy 2:1 -4
1
I exhort. therefore, that, first of all,
supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving
of thanks, be made for all men;
2 For kings, and for all that are in authority;
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and honesty.
3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of
God our savior;
4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come
unto the knowledge of the truth.
Bethlehem 11-27-88 AM
It is the will of God that all men should inherit
eternal life; but it is also the will of God that
men should do so through acceptance of the gospel
of Jesus Christ, and persons refusing to do that
must forfeit the inheritance. Another factor that
enters into the consideration is the will of man,
God having granted to all men the freedom of their
will; and, where man's will is unresponsive and
rebellious against God's will,
there can be no
salvation. God desires the salvation of all, but
the responsibility for accepting that salvation

rests squarely upon every man. As Nute said, "This
verse must not be stressed to support a numerical
universalism."
