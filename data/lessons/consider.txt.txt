Consider
Consider thyself
Galatians 6:1
Brethen, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which
are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of
meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be
tempted.
Consider
To regard with attention. Look about.
"This is a common evil; at one time or other we
have all done wrong. Either we are, or have been,
or may be, as bad as he whom we condemn. "
Galations 5:22-23
Walling 8-26-79
