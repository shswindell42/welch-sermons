11 Tim. 4:7-8
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
kept the faith:
v8
Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness
which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that
day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
appearing.
I Cor 9-244-27
24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run
all, but one receiveth the prize? so run that ye
may obtain.
25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is
temperate in all things, Now they do it to obtain
a corruptable crown: but we an incorruptable.
26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainily; so
fight I, not as one that beateth the air:
27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into
subjection: lest that by any means, when I have
preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
