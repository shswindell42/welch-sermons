SOME RESPONSIBILITIES RESTING UPON
ME AS A CHRISTIAN TOWARD
OTHER CHRISTIANS
I must answer to God for my attitude and conduct
toward other people.
Romans 14:12
12 So then every one of us shall give account of
himself to God.
We must not give account for others nor they for
us but every one for himself. We have little to do
to judge others, for they are not accountable to
us, nor are we accountable for them. They must give
account to their own master, and not to us; if we
can in anything be helpers of their joy, it is
well; but we have not dominion over their faith.
We have the more to do to judge ourselves. We
have an account of our own to make up. Let this
take up our thoughts, and he that is strict i n
judging himself will not be apt to judge aaanddsp
despise his brother.
No man can be a Christian and Christlike and b e
self-centered, and ignore other people.
Living for others is the greatest secret of h
happiness. Many are nervous wrecks because they
think of themselves all the time.
I must by love serve other Christians.
Galatians 5:13
13 For, brethen, ye have been called unto
liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion
to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
John 13:1-16
