THE RESURRECTION OF LAZARETH
Jno.
11:41-42
Introduction
This death was for the purpose of a resurrection.
Jno. 11:4
"This ssickness iis not unto death but for the glory of God
That the son of God might be glorified thereby
Death is spoken of as sleep, in a very beautiful way.
Jno 11:11
Our friend Lazareth sleepeth; but I go #that I may awake him
out of sleep
1Thess 4:13-18
But I would not have you to be ignorant brethen, concerning
them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others
which have no hope,
1.4
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so
Rax them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
15
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord
shall not prevent them which are asieep.
16
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump
of gods and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
17
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the
air: and so shall we ever be with the karadx Lord.
18
Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
The tenderness and sympathy of Jesus is msde known.
Jno 11:35
Jesus wept
Many have quoted this not knowing the occasion
2
# thank thee that thou hast heard me.
1Peter 3:12
S
For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ear
are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is
against them that do evil.
1 John 3:22
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
commandments, and do those things that are plessing in his s
sight.
Jesus thanked God
We may suppose all the miracles done by Jesus were through
answer to his prayers.
The conclusion of the blind man
dno 9: 30-31
The man answeredand said unto them, Why herein is a
marvelous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and
yet he hath opened mine eyes.
v31
Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man
be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth
That they may believe that thou hast sent me.
#Jesus performed miracies to prove that he was the Son of God
Jno 3:2
The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rab-bi,
we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man
can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him
Many miracles were performeo to produce faith in christians
today.
If our faith is strong enough we can see those miracles
just the same as if we had been present

Jno.20: 30-31
And many other signs t uly did Jesus in the presence of
his disciples,
which are not written in this book:
v31
But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is
the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye miynt
have date through his name.
Jesus addressed God in prayer before the miracle that the
people might realize the close union between him and God,
that they may not attribute it to some trick.
The result
Many believed
Jno 11:45
Then many of the Jews which came to mary,
and had seen the
things which Jesus did, believed om on him.
Some did not
Jno 11:46
But some of them went their ways to the pharisees,
them what things Jesus had done.
and told
Both had the same opportunity.
What has been our opportunity.
