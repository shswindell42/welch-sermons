WHY WE BELIEVE IN THE CHURCH
WE BELIEVE THE CHURCHES OF CHRIST TODAY ARE
SCRIPTURAL CHURCHES
We believe in the same identical godly life required
in New Testament times.
Titus 2:11-14
11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation
hath appeared to all men,
12
Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly
lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, a n d
Godly, in this present world;
13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious
appearing of the great God and our savior Jesus
Christ.
14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us
from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works.
15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke
with all authority. Let no man despise thee,
