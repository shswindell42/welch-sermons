BURDEN
BEARING
Ps 55:22 IPet 5:7 Gal 6:1-5
The value of burdens should be known
God has given some burdens; Why ?
If they come frome God, they are good.
James 1: 17
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
variableness, neither shadow of turning.
All gifts that truly bless are Gods gifts
God is the source of all material light.
God is the source of all moral light.
God is unchangeable, always the same, nor does he cast a
shadow of turning like the sun. this is an allusion to the
constantly changing shadows of objects in the sunlight caused
by the movement of the earth, not the sun. The sun stays in
the same place and casts her light in the same way day after
day.
