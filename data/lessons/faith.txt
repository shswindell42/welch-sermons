Hebrews 11:17-19
By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac:
and he that had received the promises offered up his
only begotten son,
18 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed-
be called:
19 Accounting that God was able to raise him up,
even from the dead; from whence also he received him
in a figure.
James 2 : 21
Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when
he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
Without question, these verses refer to the most
astounding demonstration of true faith in God to be
found in the entire history of faith. Abraham's faith
had already been cited by the author of Hebrews, but
in these verses is an even more overwhelming example
of it. Students of God's word in all ages have
marvelled at it; and, in the words of Albert Barnes,
"It is the strongest illustration of faith undoubtedly
which has ever been evinced in our world" ..

It is said in Genesis that God did "tempt" Abraham,
but the word "tried" is the true meaning. The true
meaning is to subject faith to a trial in order to
test its genuineness.
That God never temps any man in the sense of an
inducement to do evil is certain.
James 1: 13

Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of
God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither
tempteth he any man:

God had promised Abraham that all of the blessings
of the new covenant were to be through the descendents
of Isasc. Now God commands Isaac to be offered as a
sacrifice. Any man of ordinary faith would have
concluded that the two aspects of Gods word were
irreconcilable and would have rejected the command to
offer up Isaac, such a command being contary to every
instinct of Abraham's heart and which seemed, on its
face, to nullify the promise of an innumerable
posterity through Isaac.
The manner in which Abraham reconciled God's
arent
apparently contradictory messages constitutes the
glory of his faith.
When God commanded Abraham to offer up Isaac, Abraham
was about 130 years old. And Isaac was in the prime
of life. Adam Clark concludes that he was 33years
of age. It is implicit that Isaac should have been
about the same age of Christ when he was crucified.
The common Sunday school card presenting Isaac as a
beautiful little boy when Abraham offered him is
ridiculous. Being in the prime and vigor of life,
the heir apparent of all that Abraham had, and
possessing without doubt the loyalty of every servant
Abraham owned, Isaac would most certainly have had
the power to frustrate Abraham's purpose if he had
chosen to do so. His consent was therefore just as
vital a part of that great demonstration of faith as
was Abraham's willingness to obey.

There are a number of typical things in Rebekah as a
prefiguration of the church.
Isaac courted her
through a messenger as Christ woos souls through a
messenger.
Read Genesis 24:14-20
For Rebekah there was a water test, as there is for
the church in baptism.
Rebekah received many valuable gifts:
Genesis 24:53
And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and
jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to
Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her
mother precious things.
The world receives many prime benefits through God's
blessing on his church.
