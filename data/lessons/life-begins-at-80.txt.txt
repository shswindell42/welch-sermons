LIFE BEGINS AT 80
I have good news for you. The first 80 years
are the hardest. The second 80 are a series of
birthday parties.
Once you reach 80, every one wants to carry
your baggage and help you up the steps. If you
forget your name or anybody els's name, or an
appointment, or your own telephone number, or
promise to be in three places at the same time,
or cant remember how many grandchildren you
have, you need only explain that you are 80.
Being 80 is a lot better than being 70. At 70
people are mad at you for everything. At 80
you have a perfect excuse no matter what you do.
If you act foolishly, it's your second chilhood.
Everybody is look ng for symptons of softening
of the brain.
Being 70 is no fun at all. At that age they
expect you to retire to a house in Florida and
complain about your artheitis ( they used to call
it lumbago), and you ask everybody to stop
mumbling because you can't understand, (actually
your hearing is about 50% gone. )
If you survive until youare 80, everybody is
surprised that you are still alive. They treat
you with respect just for having lived so long.
Actually they seem surprised that you can walk
and talk sensibly. So please, folks, try to make
it to 80. It's the best time of life. People forgi
ve you for anything. If you ask me, life begins
at 80 !!!
