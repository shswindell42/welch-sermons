CANAAN IS A TYPE OF HEAVEN
Hebrews 11 :9
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise,
as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles
with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of
the same promises
The land of Canaan was a beautiful land and
was called by a beautiful name "Beulah Land".

Shem Holy Land
Jesus
For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good
land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains
and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;
8
A land of wheat, and barley, and vines,
and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of
olive oil, and honey;
Deuteronomy 11 : 10-11
10 For the land, whither thou goeth in to
possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from
whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed,
and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of
herbs :
11 But the land, whither whither ye go to possess
it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh
water of the rain of heaven:
Numbers 13:23
23 And they came unto the brook of Esh'col,
and cut down from thence a branch with one
cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two
upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates,
and of the figs.

SPIRITUAL HEAVEN
The Apostle John was permitted to see these
marvelous sights and to reveal the things he
saw to you and I.
Revelation 21 :2
And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,
coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as
a bride adorned for her husband. 3
IdIIhbandd
3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying
Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and
he will dwell with them, and they shall be his
people, and God himself shall be with them, and
be their God.
4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any
more pain: for the former things are passed
away.
9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels
which had the seven vials full of the seven last
plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither,
I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.
10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a
great and high mountain, and showed me that
great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out
of heaven from God, To here 3- 23-80 KM
11 Having the glory of God: and her light was
like unto a stone most precious, even like
a
jasper stone, clear as crystal;
12 And had a wall great and high, and had
twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels,
and names written thereon, which are the names
of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
13 On the east three gates; on the north three
gates; on the south three gates; and on the west
three gates.
14 And the wall of the city had twelve found-
ations, and in them the names of the twelve
apostles of the Lamb.
15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed
to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and
the wall thereof.
3
16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length
is as large as the breadth: and he measured the
city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The
length and the breadth and the height of it are
equal.
17 And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred
and forty and four cubits, according to the
measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
18 And the building of the wall of it was of
jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto
clear glass.
19 And the foundations of the wall of the city
were garnished with all manner of precious
stones. The first foundation was jasper; the
second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the
fourth, an emerald;
20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the
seventh, chrysolite; the eight , beryl; the ninth,
a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh,
a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
21
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls;
every several gate was of one pearl: and the
street of the city was pure gold, as it were
transparent glass.
22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord
God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither
the of the moon to shine in it: for the glory
of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
thereof.
Revelation 22:1
1 And he showed me a pure river of water of
life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the
throne of God and of the Lamb.
2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either
side of the river, was there the tree of life,
which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded
her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree
were for the healing of the nations.
3 And there shall be no more curse: but the
throne of God and of the Lambshall be in it; and
his servants shall serve him:
4
4 And they shall see his face; and his name
shall be in his foreheads.
5 And there shall be no night there; and they
need no candle, neither light of the sun; for
the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall
reign for ever and ever.
