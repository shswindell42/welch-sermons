WHY WE BELIEVE IN A RESURRECTION
AND ETERNAL JUDGEMENT
Introduction
A resurrection is no more impossible than the cre
creation of the body from the dust in the first
place.
Genesis 1:26+31
26 And God said, Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness: and let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
air, and over the cattle, and over all the tearth,
and over every creeping thing
that creepeth upon
the earth.
27 So God created man in his own image, in the
image of God created he him; male and female
created he them.
28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them,
Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth,
and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every
herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all
the earth, and every tree, in the which is the
fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be
for meat.
30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every
il of the air, and to every thing that creepeth
upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have
given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31 And God saw everything that he had made, and
behold, it was very good. And the evening and the
evening and the morning were the sixth day.
