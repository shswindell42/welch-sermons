James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him
askof God, that giveth to all men liberally,

and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

And who is there that does not want wisdom under
any great trials to guide him in his judging
of things, in the government of his own spirit
and temper, and in the management of his affairs?
To be wise in trying times is a special gift of
God, and to him we must seek for it. . This is to
be obtained upon our asking for it. Let the TI
foolish become beggars at the throne of grace,
and they are in a fair way to be wise. We
are not to ask of man, no, not any man, but,
"Let him ask of God, " who made him, and gave
him his understanding and reasonable powers II
at first, of him in whom are all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge. Let us confess our
want of wisdom to God and daily ask it of him.

and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
THE HOPE OF EVERY MAN IS THERE
Hebrews 6:19 Which hope we have as an anchor of
the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which

OUR LORD IS THERE
John 14:1-3
1 Let not your heart be troubled:
ye believe in God, believe also in me.
2 In my Fathers house are many mansions : : if it
were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepa
prepare a place for you.
3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I
will come again, and receive you unto myself;
that where I am, there ye may be also.
OUR NAMES ARE WRITTEN THERE
Luke 10:20 Notwithstanding, rin this rejoice not,
that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather
rejoice, because your names are written in heaven
BECAUSE IT IS THE CITY OF THE GATE OF REFUGE
Hebrews 6:18 That by two immutable things,
in which it was impossible for God to lie, we
might have a strong consolation, who have fled
