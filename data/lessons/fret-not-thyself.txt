Psalms 37

vexation, annoyance as if some thing were gnawing in-
side one.
Considering the problems and frustrations David faced

as well as to men in general.
There are similar passages in
Phillipians 4: 6
6 Be careful for nothing; but in everything by
prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
requests be made known unto God.
Matthew 6:34
34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for
the morrow shall take thought for the things of it-
self. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. .

from one point to another. The first point is the
human heart; the line is its intense desire; and
the last point is God, to whom this heart extends
this straight line of earnest desire to be filled
with the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of
peace.
