WHAT ARE THE GREATEST
THINGS OF LIFE
The greatest loss in life is to lose one's soul
This would be infinitely worse than losing a
million dollars.
Matthew 16:26
26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain
the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what
shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Read Matthew 25:31-46
