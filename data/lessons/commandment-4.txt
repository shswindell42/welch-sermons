THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT
Against Profanation of the Sabbath
Gonesis 2:2-3
2
And on the seventh day God onded his work which
he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from
all his work which he had made.
3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified
it: because that in it he had rested from all his
work which he had made.
Many centuries were to pass before man was to
observe
the Sabbath day religeously. When God
called Moses upon Mt. Sinai God delivered to him
the law that made the observance of
the Sabbath
a part.
Exodus 20:8-11
8
Remember the Sabbath day to koop it holy.
9
Six days shalt thou labor , and do all thy work :
10
But the growth day is tho sabbath of the Lord
thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou,
nor
thy son, mor thy daughter, thy mangervant, nor
thy maidsorvant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger
that is within thy gatos:
11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
the soa, and all that in them is, ind rested the
seventh day: wherefore the Lord blossod the sabbath
day, and hallowed it.
Remember
do not forget
Sabbath ....... rest in glory ....
Typifies the rest which remains for the people
of God.
Exodus from Egypt. ..... many types. . .. Promised land
Heaven
All types are in full force till the thing signified
by them takes place.

Why not Observe the Old Testament Sabbath Today?
The Law of Moses, of which the sabbath commandment
was a part, was given only to the people of Israel.
It was never given to the people of any other race.
No Gentile was ever commanded to keep the sabbath,
Since the sabbath commandment was part of the Law
of Moses it was to endure only as long as that
law should last. It was never given to be permanent
but was "added because of transgressions, till
the seed should come" (Gal 3:19) ..
The seed is Christ, hence, the Law was to last
until Christ should come and the new covenant
should go into effect. Christ having already come,
the Law of Moses is binding no more and there is
now no sabbath commandment binding upon the Israelite
or any one else.
Read Hebrews 8:6-10
Colossians 2:14
14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances
that was against us, which was contrary to us,
and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross,
Matthew 5:17
17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law,
or the prophets. I am not come to destroy, but
to fulfil ..
The Lord has a special day now
Revolation 1 :10
10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and
heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet
Acts 20:7
7 And upon the first day of the week, when the
disciples came together to break bread, Paul
preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow;
and continued his speech until midnight.

ON THE LORDS DAY
Jesus rose from the dead
The Holy Spirit was imparted
The Church was established
People were added to the Church
If we take the Lords Day and and appropriate it
to our own use we rob God.
