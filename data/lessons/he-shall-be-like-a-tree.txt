HE SHALL BE LIKE A TREE
Psalms 1:1-3
Man is likened to several things in the Bible.
Man is likened to a planted tree.
Planted by the rivers of waters.
Read Romans 6:3-5
Christians have also been planted.
A tree is a rooted thing.
Christians are rooted and built up in Christ.
Colossians 2: 7
Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the
faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein
with thanksgiving.
Your life growing out of him as a tree out of the
soil. The point of the exhortation is to cling to
the gospel as it has been taught you.
To receive Christ is but the beginning.
Rooted
Built up
Established
Abounding in thanksgiving
Takes time for a tree to become rooted.
Takes time for a person to become established in
the faith.
Hebrews 5:12
Bethlehem mag 38 98
12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers,
ye have that one teach you again which be the first
principles of the oracles of God; and are become such
as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

Paul used the same metaphor in
I Corinthians 3:2-3
have
I/fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto
ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are able.
3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among
envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal,
and walk as men?
A tree is a growing thing
A tree is planted"By the rivers of water"
place
of nutriment
The law of nature demands that a tree grow.
The law of God demands that a child of his grow.
I Peter 2:2
2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the
word, that ye may grow thereby:
It is hard for a tree to grow out of it's native
climate.
It is hard for a christian to grow in some environ-
ments.
I Corinthians 15:33
33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt
good manners.
Some believe this expression had passed into the
Greek language as proverb.
It is hard to quit smoking in company with smokers.
It is hard to quit drinking in the company of drinkers

The truth spoken is timeless and applicable to all
who ever lived in any generation.
5 A tree is a living thing
A tree lives in all seasons
God made us living creatures

Genesis 2:7
7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the
ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life; and man became a living soul.
In the most distinct manner God shows us that man
AT
is a compound thing
Body .... dust of the earth
Soul ..... God breathed
John 11:25
25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection,
and the life: he that believeth in me, though he
were dead, yet shall he live:
In this lies the full explation of Jesus words in
John 8: 51
51
Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man keep
my saying, he shall never see death.
This is not a promise of escape from mortality
but a promise of eternal life, and no more glorious
promise was ever made to man.
v25
I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE
This healing, comforting, and consoling message has
echoed
over many, many graves.

Martha found little comfort in the thought of a
resurrection at the last day; but Jesus said, "I
am the resurrection and the life." it is faith in
a person, even in Jesus, that makes all the differ-
ence.
This means Jesus is God in human form, a truth he
promptly proved by raising Lazarus. Jesus had claimed
Godhood as Light of the world, the Good Shepherd,
the giver of eternal life, the door of the sheep,
as existing before Abraham was born, and in numerous
other ways. Here he appeared as Resurrection come
in the flesh.
This means far more than an assertion of Jesus '
power to raise Lazarus. This extends to all the
dead who ever lived. The "Come forth, " shortly to
be sounded over Lagarus' grave, in the same cry
that shall awaken all the dead on earth.
A tree is a beautiful thing.
Few things in nature as beautiful as a tree.
Nothing more beautiful than a godly life.
Romans 10:15
15 And how shall they preach, except thay be sent?
As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of
them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring
glad tidings of good things!

I SHALL NOT BE MOVED
Glory hallelujah, I shall not be moved
Anchored in Jehovah, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree thats planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

I shall not be moved.
chorus
Though all hell assail me, Ishall not be moved
Jesus will not fail me, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree thats planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

On the rock of ages, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree thats- planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree thats planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved

HE SHALL BE LIKE A TREE
Psalms 1:1-3
Psalms 1:1-3
1
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel
of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners,
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and
in his law doth he meditate day and night.
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers
of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his
season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatso-
ever he doeth shall prosper.
Man is likened to several things in the Bible.
This concludes our study of the likeness to a tree.
A TREE IS A FRUITFUL THING
Bringeth forth its fruit
Read Matthew 3:1-12
Trees may have parasitic growths.
Other plants may grow on a tree at the expense of
a tree.
Christians often have parasitic growths in their
lives.
God's children must bear fruit.

Luke 3:23
Jesus was about 30 years of age when he was baptized
John is called"the Baptist" because he baptized
people.
The wilderness of Judea

near the mouth of the Jordan River.
Repentance involves a change of the will is far
more than mere sorrow for sin.
