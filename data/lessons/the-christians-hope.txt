THE CHRISTIANS HOPE
11Cor. 5:15
We are told that the word hope is from a root which signifies,
"The opening of the eyes." It has a close family relation
with the term "gape" which describes, the opening of the
mouth. With these two related ideas in mind, it may help us
get a fair meaning of the word hope.
What is hope. How many of us have seen a little child, stand-
ing on tip toewith wide-open eyes, eagerly expecting some
wonderful sight, and with all of its nature thrilled with
interest and excitement.
Another picture is that of a nice cozy nest of newly hatched
birds, with upturned open mouths, waiting for the morsels of
food from the mother bird.
These two pictures when viewed by the THOUGHTFUL indicate the
attitude of those who look and wait in anticipation of that
which the gospel offers the obedient. It is the attitude of
expectant forelook, of confident waiting, of awakened desire
which leaps toward an assured satisfaction.
That which has just been said is the true spirit of the
christian life. It is the spirit which finds more interest
in tomorrow than yesterday. It is the spirit which lives in
the future.
The principal ingredidnts which go to make up hope are:
Expectancy -- the outlooking of the soul as opposed to the
inlooking, the looking away from self to some person or good
Desire --- one may expect something and dread it; but when es
expectation is coupled with desire, then he wants it.
Anticipation ---
the bringing of the distant and the future
near .. living in the future, as it were, before it comes,
seeing things as they will be, not merely as they are.
Someone has said that there is no more suataining and
transforming influence on human life, than the influence of
hope. If a man has hope that his weary struggle will end in
something better, then he has something to help him through
the ordeal. Sometimes a man has need of surgery and some
time it is doubtful if he will recover. Hope is a great asset
on the road to victory.

Being burdened --
The physical body is an increasing burden
with advancing years;and this is one of the sad things about
life. However powerful and glorious the physicalls body may
be for a season, the burden grows heavier and heavier till
at last the end comes.
Phil 3:21
The Lord Jesus Christ; who shall fashion anew the body of
our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his
glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to
subject all things unto himself.
Bro Goffmans Story or
Aman tells this story
I know a man at age 80 had extraordinary strength and still
led singing for the village congregation. Then one day when
he was 90 years old, he took this son into a private room and
played a recording made many years earlier when his voice
was young and beautiful and vigorous. AS we listened, both
burst into tears;
"Ah son, now we know what Paul meant by
"' The body of our humiliation'

Earnest of the Spirit
The same as earneat money on a purchase
This is a token or pledge that the whole price will be paid.
When we receive the Gift of the Holy XSpirit, that meanstn
that we have received a token and a direct guidance.
2 Corinthians 5:1-5
1 For we know that, if our earthly house of this ta
tabernacle were disolved, we have a building of
God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens.
2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to
be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
3 If so be that being clothed we shall not be
found naked. .
4. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan,
being burdened, not for that we would be uncloth ed,
but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed
up of life.
5 Now he that hast wrought us for the selfsame
thing is God, who also hath given us the earnest
of the spirit ..
