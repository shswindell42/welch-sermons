WHY WE BELIEVE THE BIBLE
From whence came this wonderful book?
It is here ! It did not write itself.
The Bible claims to have been written by
inspiration of God.
Read Psalms 14
Revelations 21 : 8
8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the
abominable, and murders, and whoremongers, and
sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall
have their part in the lake which burneth with
fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
I Timothy 5:8
8 But if any provide not for his own, and
specially for those of his own house, he hath
denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
Walling 12-30-79 am
