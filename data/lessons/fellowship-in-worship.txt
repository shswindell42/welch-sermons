FELLOWSHIP IN WORSHIP
Acts. 2:42## 47
Man is by nature a creature of worship.
"WORSHIP IS THE THE ADORING REVERENCE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT
FOR THE DIVINE"
Man may not always worship the right object or he may not
always worahip in the right way.
Before there can be true worship, there must be knowledge of
who and what.
many people through the ages have sought to worship God
according to their own i deas.
Will worship, then is not pleasing to God
The enjoyment of noble architecture and music is not worship.
